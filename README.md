## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
This is a simple Flutter UI project for a learning app. The app has basic screens like a splash screen, onboarding, login/sign-up, home, and course details. It's mainly focused on building the user interface â€” there's no backend or real data, just layout and navigation. The goal was to practice making clean, organized screens and get more comfortable with Flutter UI.
